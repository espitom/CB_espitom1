    Essay Part:

    1.What is the difference between a comparison operator and an assignment operator?
        - A comparison operators do not change any values, but returns a boolean ( true or false ) as and when a statement has a true or false assessment. While Assignment operators change or assign the value of a variable on the left of the operator.


    2.What is a Boolean? What does it represent?
        -  a boolean(one of primitive data types) is a value either TRUE or FALSE. Which represents the logic of something that is answerable by yes or no.

    3.How is the += operator different than + operator?
        - adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. While + operator adds two numeric operands.
